    "\n",
    "It is called abstraction because the abstract class BankApp defines what methods (security, display) subclasses must implement, but not how those methods should work. The abstract class provides only the method signatures, acting as a blueprint or contract. Each subclass must provide its own implementation for these methods. This way, the details of how each subclass implements security are separated from the interface defined by the abstract class, promoting abstraction by focusing on what needs to be done rather than how it is done."
