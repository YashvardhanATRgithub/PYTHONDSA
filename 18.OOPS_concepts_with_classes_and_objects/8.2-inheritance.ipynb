    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "Inheritance is a powerful feature in OOP that allows for code reuse and the creation of a more logical class structure. Single inheritance involves one base class, while multiple inheritance involves more than one base class. Understanding how to implement and use inheritance in Python will enable you to design more efficient and maintainable object-oriented programs."
