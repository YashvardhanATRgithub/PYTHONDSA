## Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

Welcome to my Python DSA repository! This repository contains my implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Python. I am continuously learning and adding new code, so stay tuned for regular updates.

### About

This repository serves as a personal learning space and a collection of Python implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms. I aim to provide clear, concise, and well-documented code for educational purposes.

### Contents

The repository is organized into the following directories:

*   **1. Python\_Basics:** Basic python programs
*   **2-Control\_Flow:** Example programs to demonstrate control flow in python
*   **3. Data\_Structures:** Implementation of Data structures like arrays, linked list, etc
*   **4-Functions:** Programs on functions
*   **5-Flowchart\_and\_problem\_solving:** Basics of flowcharts and how to approach a problem
*   **6-Pattern\_practice\_questions:** Different pattern printing questions
*   **7-Function\_practise\_questions:** More questions to practice functions
*   **8-Inbuilt\_data\_structure\_practise\_questions:** Questions to learn to use in built data structures

### How to Use

Feel free to explore the code, use it for your learning, and even contribute! If you find any errors or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

### Contributions
